# Frontend Recruitment Task

## [](#the-task)The task

Your job is to code an app with posts of users with ability to manage posts and comments. Application must be SPA and use multiple routes (listed below).

## [](#tech-stack)Tech stack:

*  API: [API DOCS](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
*  [Angular](https://angular.io/)
*  State Managment: [RxJS](https://www.learnrxjs.io/)

## [](#screens)Screens:

*  `Homepage` [![Homepage](https://github.com/propergate/recruitment/blob/main/images/HomePage.png)](/Pagepro/react-recruitment-task/blob/master/img/HomePage.png)
   *  List of users.
   *  For each user you must display his details (you can omit the address).
   *  On user click you will redirect to `User Details` page
*  `User Details` [![User Details](https://github.com/propergate/recruitment/blob/main/images/UserDetails.png)](/Pagepro/react-recruitment-task/blob/master/img/UserDetails.png)
   *  This page contains the user name at the top of the page.
   *  List of user posts (just titles trimmed to one line).
   *  On click on the post item you will redirect to `Post Details` page
   *  Button that on click will open the `Add post modal`.
   *  Back button that will go back to `Homepage`
*  `Post Details` [![User Details](https://github.com/propergate/recruitment/blob/main/images/PostDetails.png)](/Pagepro/react-recruitment-task/blob/master/img/PostDetails.png) [![User Details comments](https://github.com/propergate/recruitment/blob/main/images/PostDetailsComments.png)](/Pagepro/react-recruitment-task/blob/master/img/PostDetailsComments.png)
   *  On top of the page you still have the username
   *  Post full details
   *  Button to remove post.
   *  On remove you will have to go back to `User Details` page and remove current post from the list and API.
   *  Button/link for comments 'show/hide comments' that will toggle the comments list visibility.
   *  Button to add comment.
   *  Adding comments should be similar to `Add Post Modal` but contain different fields and action.
   *  Back button that will go back to `Posts list
*  `Add Post/Comment Modal` [![Add Post Modal](https://github.com/propergate/recruitment/blob/main/images/AddPostModal.png)](/Pagepro/react-recruitment-task/blob/master/img/AddPostModal.png) [![Add Comment Modal](https://github.com/propergate/recruitment/blob/main/images/AddCommentModal.png)](/Pagepro/react-recruitment-task/blob/master/img/AddCommentModal.png)
   *  Title
   *  Form fields
   *  Two buttons `Cancel`, `Save`
   *  Cancel will just close the modal and ignore changes
   *  Save will connect with API and add Comment/Post to the list
