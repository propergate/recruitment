# Frontend Recruitment Task

## [](#the-task)The task

Your job is to code an REST API based on screens and description of [frontend task](https://github.com/propergate/recruitment/blob/main/FRONTEND.md)
Perfectly both tasks can work together.

## [](#tech-stack)Tech stack:

Please use clean NodeJS, without any frameworks (ex. Express). Of course you can use another js libraries. We just want to see and understand your thinking and coding process (frameworks like Express have lot of completed solutions so it's too easy for recruitment test :smiley:)
